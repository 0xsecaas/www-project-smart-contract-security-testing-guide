The Smart Contract Security Testing Guide (SCSTG) is a comprehensive framework designed to assist developers, auditors, and security professionals in evaluating the security of smart contracts. It provides detailed methodologies for identifying, verifying, and addressing vulnerabilities in smart contracts across various risk categories. The guide includes examples of common security flaws, methods for detecting these issues, and strategies for mitigating or eliminating the risks.
